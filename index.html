    <h3>
      About Mahjur
    </h3>
    <p>I am a Computer Science Graduate from the University of Minnesota. During my time there, I found myself doing a lot by involved with many extracurricular activities like being the Director of Public relations of the Student Association, Intramural Basketball, Football, and Softball, as well as going out taking photography of people and nature itself. During all of this, I was also coding to improve my skills as a software engineer since my passion was always that! </p>
